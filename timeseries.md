# Gen AI with Time series data 

##We have plenty of timeseries data around us. 

Some of the persoanl examples are our 
- own heart beat, 
- body temperature, 

Some of location specific examples are 
- airquality parameters in a location, 
- energy consumption of a building
- amount of rainfall in a city 

Some of enterprise specific examples are 
- energy consumption in a cement industry 
- energy consumption in a mall or an office building 
- different parameters of a robot in an auto industry 
- asset performance parameters 
- number of products sold 

## Time series data comes very handy in answering two important questions and technically they translate to two different tech capabilities

1. Is everything ok ? Is it normal  : This relates to anomaly detection 
2. How will this be in the future ?  : This relates to forecasting 

### Is everything ok or is something wrong & How will this be in the future ?

For example, in a classroom, a teacher may say to a student "are you ok ? I see a difference today ". This comes because of teacher's observation of the student over a period of time. In computer science specifically data science, machine learning is used to do the same. A machine, in this case, computer is learning by not watching something for a period of time but by looking at the historical data and using that anomaly detection will be done. 

Next question is how will this student perform in the future ? This again can be predicted using that learning. In order to get accurate outputs, teacher need to observe each student and in machine learning case,
- one model is needed for every parameters ( in this example : student )
- more importantly each model needs to be trained with historical data. 

If there is no historical data, then model cannot do the anomaly detection or even if it did, the accuracy will be very very poor.

### How does Gen AI solve this

What if there is a foundation model trained on time series data with various patterns. thats exactly what the timeseries foundation models do. Time series models are transforming the forecasting across industry. There are many time series foundation models in the market. Some of them are 

1. IBM Granite TinyTimeMixer (TTM) model
2. TimesFM : Time Series Foundation Model by Google research
3. TimeGPT-1 :
